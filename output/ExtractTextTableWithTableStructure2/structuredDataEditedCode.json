      "Text": "We explore how the context of an organizational workgroup affects the relationship between group diversity and various performance outcomes. In particular, we theorize and empirically examine the moderating effects of three categories of workgroup context variables: cultures (people-and competition-oriented), strategies (stability-, growth-and customer-oriented), and human resource practices (diversity-and training-oriented). We perform analyses on 1528 workgroups from a Fortune 500 information-processing firm. The results showed, for example, that members of groups diverse in functional background were paid higher composite bonuses when their workgroup context emphasized people-oriented cultures and lower levels of bonuses in contexts with a focus on stability-oriented strategies. In addition, members of groups diverse in level of education were awarded higher amounts of bonuses in workgroup environments that emphasized customer-and growth-oriented strategies. However, members of such groups had lower levels of composite bonuses in environments that focused on training-and diversity-oriented human resource practices. We discuss future research directions regarding diversity, workgroup context, and performance outcomes and outline some implications for managers and group leaders.

The emphasis on workgroups over more traditional corporate hierarchies in organizations has become a popular strategy and is often assumed to improve effectiveness (Bishop, Scott, & Burroughs, 2000). Research has shown, for example, that workgroups are more effective owing to their capacity to adjust to new information and challenges with greater speed, accuracy, and efficiency (Cohen & Bailey, 1997). Furthermore, companies are recognizing the need to leverage the diversity of their employees in order to sustain their competitive advantages in a global marketplace (Offerman & Gowing, 1990; Thomas & Ely, 1996; Yaprak, 2002). Specifically, the international trend toward increased immigration and the globalization of firms (Johnson, 2002; Yaprak, 2002) and the domestic trend toward an aging workforce and a greater "

      "Text": "The challenges created by these trends are difficult to translate into solutions for managers and group leaders faced with the day-to-day supervision of diverse groups. Company leaders often presume that greater diversity will automatically lead to (often unspecified) benefits while ignoring the complicated issues of managing diverse teams (Kersten, 2000; Shaw & Barrett-Power, 1998). However, without creating a proper workgroup context conducive to realizing the value in diversity, managers may be left balancing a more complicated but no more productive workplace. Moreover, according to a review by Milliken and Martins (1996, p. 403), ‘diversity appears to be a double-edged sword, increasing the opportunity for creativity as well as the likelihood that group members will be dissatisfied and fail to identify with the group.’ In order to account for such potentially harmful consequences of diversity, researchers have been looking at the intervening role of various group processes (e.g., conflict, communication, information sharing) (e.g., Bunderson & Sutcliffe, 2002; Pelled, Eisenhardt, & Xin, 1999; Smith et al., 1995). However, to more fully understand the effects of diversity in groups, the influence of contextual settings on individuals and groups in which they work also should be considered (Rousseau & Fried, 2001). Thus, more studies are needed to further investigate how context influences diverse groups to shape performance, and to provide managers and organizations with knowledge and recommendations for effective diversity management.

In particular, while some prior studies show positive effects (Hoffman & Maier, 1961; Hoffman, 1978; Jehn et al., 1999; Watson, Kumar, & Michaelson, 1993), even more show that diversity can have negative effects on performance (Ancona & Caldwell, 1992; O’Reilly & Flatt, 1989; Steiner, 1972). The evidence is complicated because diversity seems to interact with a variety of other group and organizational factors (Williams & O’Reilly, 1998). Even though a few studies have looked carefully at the effects of these factors on the relationship between diversity and outcomes (cf. Chatman, Polzer, Barsade, & Neale, 1998; Jehn et al., 1999) and despite widespread public opinion of the virtues of diversity, the empirically beneficial link between diversity and group, business, or organizational performance still remains unproven. Thus, departing from prior research that focused primarily on the direct effects of diversity on performance, we explore when and how diversity affects performance and what organizations can do to translate diversity into positive performance outcomes. In particular, we ask the question: To what extent do contextual factors determine whether workplace diversity is beneficial or detrimental to performance? Specifically, we examine certain cultures, business strategies, and human resource practices as workgroup contexts. Below, we develop and discuss a conceptual model of diversity to illustrate the specified relationships. "

Diversity is traditionally conceptualized in terms of visible differences in age, gender, and race (Hicks-Clarke & Illes, 2000).

Mowday and Sutton (1993, p. 198) define context as ‘stimuli and phenomena that surround and thus exist in the environment external to the individual, most often at a different level of analysis.’ According to Johns (2001), the context of individuals and groups often works in such a way as to encourage or impede behavior and attitudes in organizational settings. Recent research on diversity has suggested that cultures, business strategies, and human resource practices may be of great importance when considering the effects of group diversity (Chatman et al., 1998; Richard & Kirby, 1997; Richard, 2000).

Chatman et al.

In particular, group culture as a social control system can moderate the impact of diversity on performance by reinforcing positive views of diversity and rewarding its presence and successful management (O’Reilly & Chatman, 1996). In one study, for example, an organizational culture supporting ethnic diversity was reported to have positive effects on performance (O’Reilly, Williams, & Barsade, 1997).

Individualistic cultures, on the other hand, emphasize self-orientation, competition, uniqueness, autonomy, independence, and achievement (Triandis & Suh, 2002). Whereas these two focuses have received much attention in the literature as nation-, industry-, organization-, and occupation-level phenomena (e.g., Chatman & Jehn, 1994; Perlow & Weeks, 2002; Triandis & Gelfand, 1998; Workman, 2001), we argue that cultures are also an important factor of workgroup environments in organizations.

Using a business simulation, Chatman et al. (1998) found that participants viewed demographic diversity as more beneficial for groups with collectivistic cultures as they were less likely to perceive differences among themselves and experience negative effects of categorization processes. The researchers proposed that these effects may occur due to common fate, shared values, and a sense of in-group membership facilitated by such cultures.

Each year this group, comprised of employees at every level and in every department of the company, helps to create diversity action plans. In the past decade, a number of other innovative practices have emerged to promote and maintain diversity within the company. For example, each department is required to submit an end-of-year report measuring how well the unit performed against its diversity objectives. This report details quantitative information on diversity initiatives, including the hiring and promotion of women and minorities, succession planning, development, retention, and training. This approach has resulted in a number of tools designed to support the company’s diversity objectives. For instance, all department newsletters now cover diversity issues, employees have access to lecture series on diversity, and a ‘Managing Diversity’ module is taught at every manager orientation session.

Special emphasis is placed on recognizing the contributions of people from diverse cultures, backgrounds, and lifestyles, and creating environments in which these people feel comfortable and are treated with respect. These efforts are made in order to give the company ‘a competitive advantage by harnessing the power that diversity may bring.’ According to Thomas and Ely’s (1996) three organizational diversity perspectives, such efforts would be aligned with the ‘integration and learning’ perspective. This perspective suggests that the organization is committed to diversity because it believes that it can learn from the eclectic backgrounds, knowledge bases, and experiences of different people, and can translate this knowledge and learning into positive results. We would like to note that, based on the researchers’ experiences in the company and with the data collected, the two other perspectives (discrimination and fairness; access and legitimacy) are also evident in the day-to-day conversations of the company’s upper management and in the rhetoric that the top managers use in public forums (e.g., speeches to employees, guest speaking at universities) and there is also much variation across business units, divisions, and even departments. The legal components representative of the ‘discrimination and fairness’ perspective, for example, were exhibited in numerous meetings of various departments. The ‘access and legitimacy’ perspective was prevalent in one-on-one interviews with upper-level executives from various divisions and in the public speeches that they made as well. They focused the reasoning for their diversity efforts on the match with their customer base and the markets they wanted to reach. Thus, this company appears to draw on all three of the Thomas and Ely’s (1996) perspectives in justifying and managing its diversity efforts. Our empirical data on the contextual variables (see below in the measures section) reiterates this variance within the firm. "

They then sorted the competencies into seven key phrase lists based on relevant organizational theories regarding group cultures, strategies, and HR practices, as well as the concepts used in the company’s rhetoric (see Appendix). The level of initial agreement between the two raters was 84 percent. Second, the two raters together reviewed the descriptions and phrase lists of the context variables for each competency, discussed each definition and phrase list until they had a common understanding of it, and then refined the key phrase list for each variable studied. Third, when the key phrase lists were complete, the data was organized by department. Fourth, this data was searched for the words from the key phrase lists using the program MonoConc Pro 2.0 (Barlow, 2000) to obtain frequencies of context-variable phrase occurrence. Finally, to arrive at a score for each workgroup context variable, the percentage of total relevant hits for a particular variable representing each group were summed. This procedure allowed us to make direct quantitative comparisons of groups within various workgroup environments using established computer-aided text analysis techniques successfully employed in past organizational research (e.g., Abrahamson & Hambrick, 1997; Doucet & Jehn, 1997; Kabanoff, 1997).

As shown in Table 1b3, this type of culture moderated the effects of group diversity in functional background on composite bonuses; members of these groups were paid higher amounts of composite bonuses in the departments that cultivated people-oriented cultures. Unlike what was expected, groups diverse in level of education had lower amounts of composite bonuses in contexts that focused on people-oriented cultures than in those without such emphasis (see Table 1b3). Furthermore, while the interaction coefficient between age diversity and people-oriented cultures appeared significant and in the predicted direction, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that this is a statistically significant result based on Cohen and Cohen’s (1983) regression significance standards as the F change statistic failed to reach statistical significance.

This is consistent with our predictions and suggests that people-oriented workgroup environments emphasizing collectivity and group work can actually facilitate the alignment of actions of diverse employees with desired performance outcomes. One possible explanation for this effect is that group members in such environments may be less likely to categorize themselves based on their functional background and accompanying social status. They are more likely to be concerned with their group success (Workman, 2001), to recognize the contributions of all members regardless of their area of expertise, to experience high-quality information exchanges, and to exhibit less withdrawal behaviors. As a result, group members in such environments may generate more sales, shorter response times, less error rates, and more customer satisfaction and quality—performance aspects typically associated with bonuses (Lowery et al., 2002; Thompson, 2004).

One possible explanation for why competition-oriented cultures did not moderate the effect of group diversity on performance is that the individualistic values (which characterize competition-oriented cultures) can be inherently in conflict with the synergy usually generated out of group work. For example, from supplementary textual information made available by the company, we found that group members in competition-oriented environments believe that their ‘culture of ownership’ is what drives them to success. A call for the culture of competition and ownership may essentially promote a sense of ‘self’ above and beyond a collective sense of ‘we.’ Furthermore, members within such contexts can be seen as a constellation of individuals working independently with only necessary and minimal interaction with one another. The theories explaining workgroup interaction all assume that negative effects of diversity can be attributed to conflicts that arise from negative stereotypes or biases and escalate as group members interact within their group (Williams & O’Reilly, 1998). Perhaps, in such environments (e.g., competitive, individualistic), there may not be sufficient conditions for conflicts to arise and affect outcomes negatively due to this minimal interaction among group members.

For example, employees in some extremely profit-oriented departments (e.g., sales) working in competitive group environments may have more room to be different and focus on individual accomplishments than those in more bureaucratized departments (e.g., administrative or accounting), but working in otherwise identical groups. While the environment may be competitive in both cases (for example, in sales a competition culture may foster competitive attitudes over the clientele, whereas in administrative departments such a culture may reflect one’s desire to retain his/her job), each unit’s competition culture is a function of its respective job settings. As such, an employee in an administrative department may value diversity less than an employee in a sales department if the specific job criteria in the administrative departments are not directly tied to diversity. Future research should investigate the resulting impact of competition culture and job characteristics on the relationship between group diversity and outcomes. "

A possible explanation is that growth-oriented groups need to embrace diversity as a resource to further fuel creativity and innovation of their groups, on which they depend for success. We further found that groups diverse in functional background performed worse in stability-oriented strategic environments than in environments that did not focus on stability and efficiency. Perhaps such groups either discourage diversity or prefer not to embrace it so that they may better maintain the stable status quo that allows them to successfully strive for peak efficiency. Thus, "

Contrary to what was expected, groups diverse in level of education performed worse in environments with an emphasis on training-and diversity-oriented HR practices. A possible explanation is that when these groups are placed in environments that focus on training-oriented and diversity HR practices, the costs of such HR practices may exceed the benefits produced, leading to a net reduction in performance. It may also be that groups that were the focus of training and diversity practices had correspondingly higher expectations placed on them, and so their performance indicators are low because they were judged against this higher standard. Another explanation is that these HR practices might be introduced for groups in which members are viewed as needing such support. For example, an organization may make an effort to compensate for educational or skill deficiencies of group members by offering specialized training that brings employees up to the required standards (Moskos & Butler, 1996). Or a group may be identified as needing to focus on diversity because it has problems, thus suggesting an already existing negative relationship or low performance selection criteria. Future research should examine why certain groups are selected for specific HR practices and what the implications are for implementing such programs and practices in these groups. "

In such groups the differences in age, race, gender, and tenure may have become less relevant and important over time as group members cooperate with each other and spend a substantial amount of time performing together in specific contexts. For example, Harrison, Price, Gavin, and Florey (2002) have shown that as group members collaborate, the effects of surface-level diversity (e.g., gender, race) on group outcomes become much weaker than the effects of deep-level diversity (e.g., values, personalities).

Overall, our findings are consistent with past diversity research in that there are mixed main effects of the different diversity characteristics on different performance outcomes (see Table 1a; cf. Williams & O’Reilly, 1998). To remedy the shortcomings of past diversity research and the inconsistency in results, further developments of alternative ways in which group diversity can be conceptualized and operationalized are needed. One of the most intriguing advancements along these lines comes from a theory of group faultlines introduced by Lau and Murnighan (1998). Group faultlines occur in groups when a group splits into two subgroups based on the alignment of one or more demographic attributes (e.g., race and gender). Past diversity studies have often ignored individuals’ multiple demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race, age) and the alignment of these characteristics across group members, which can be crucial for understanding the effects of group composition on workgroup context and outcomes. The theory of group faultlines allows group composition researchers to make predictions about group interactions based on multiple member demographic characteristics and their alignment within the group. While the faultline construct is an intriguing new conceptualization of group composition, future research should gear towards its empirical testing to help explain the mixed results past research has found between diversity and performance. In addition, this theory offers interesting avenues for the study of the effects of group and organizational context on the group composition–performance relationship. "

This research should be done within a configurational framework that would seek the most effective alignment of human resource practices, business strategies, and organizational cultures for group diversity to be beneficial.

Our findings suggest that managers may capitalize on certain types of demographic diversity in groups if they take into account the appropriate workgroup environment. For instance, an ideal workgroup environment for groups that are diverse in functional background should emphasize a sense of group identity and common fate, and foster good relationships. Managers of such groups should avoid placing their groups in a stability-oriented environment with an extremely high focus on efficiency because this may interfere with employees’ productivity. In cases where diverse groups already operate in stable environments, managers may leverage diversity by encouraging and implementing common, specific, and status-quo task goals so that the differences present are focused on a team meta-goal of maintaining stability and efficiency. Our findings further suggest that diversity in level of education can be beneficial in work-group environments that support customer-focused values and emphasize change and innovation. Managers of such groups should consider creating a more flexible, customer-oriented environment in which these diverse group members are given sufficient time to embrace and capitalize on their differences. In sum, we suggest that companies can improve the performance of their groups and individuals by establishing and promoting specific work environments in which a particular type of diverse group can thrive.
