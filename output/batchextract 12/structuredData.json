Successful students at all grade levels are self-regulated learners who assess their knowledge and examine their cognitive processes, abilities that become more important as students move from elementary to middle and high schools. Because skillful students are able to think about their own thinking, they can track their progress and reflect on their learning. However, many struggling students fail to understand the learning process and lack introspective skills, resulting in unproductive approaches to their schoolwork. Through metacognitive instruction, these students become aware of their own thinking and learn to work through challenges without undue frustration (Hoyt & Sorensen, 2001; Lifford, Byron, & Ziemian, 2000; Peverly, Brobst, & Morris, 2002).

Becoming a strategic learner through meta-cognitive awareness is a developmental and instructional process influenced by teachers’ methods and materials (Jacobs, 2003; Paris & Paris, 2001). Educators recognize that students need to learn higher level thinking skills of metacognition because cognitive demands become more complex from one grade to the next. Instruction in meta-cognition at the elementary school level increases because research has indicated that even young students are able to monitor and assess their own learning. At the secondary school level, studies of adolescent learning have revealed that metacognitive awareness prompts students to develop practical thinking skills to use in their coursework and in life (Moje, 2002; Williams et al., 2002). Through the lifelong skill of metacognitive thinking, students can be taught to reflect on their own learning processes while they complete learning tasks.

Another reason for neglecting metacognition is that instructional time is at a premium, with teachers responding to the pressures of state assessment testing and to the demands of local curriculum guidelines; therefore, the emphasis on learning strategies is limited. However, educators need to remember an essential question: What is more important than spending time teaching the critical thinking skills needed for independent learning? Encouraging students to practice reflective thinking does not add extra content; rather, it is a tool for mastering existing content.

In addition, teachers should use writing activities, such as reading logs and self-assessment checklists, to promote metacognitive growth because these exercises encourage students to reflect on their learning processes (Paris & Paris, 2001; Peverly et al., 2002).
