However, the term metacognition does not embrace just metacognitive experience, but overlaps with the concept of motivation.

In our model we assumed that initial motivation -consisting of task-specific mastery confidence, incompetence fear, challenge, and interest -helped knowledge acquisition via two mediating variables: strategy systematicity and motivational state during learning. Whereas strategy systematicity is a cognitive process variable indicating how systematically participants explore the material, motivational state monitors aspects of their motivational process such as how much fun participants have during the learning task, and their confidence in finding the correct solution. This confidence relates to what participants feel during learning, and is part of what has been studied under the label metacognitive experience. Previous empirical studies (Vollmeyer, Rollett, & Rheinberg, 1997, 1998) showed that participants who were more confident and had less fear chose more systematic strategies, and had a more positive motivational state (i.e., had more fun and were more confident during learning). Both of these mediator variables led to more knowledge acquisition. When participants had to apply their acquired knowledge, again the motivational state was associated with higher performance.

In our previous studies we have used only strategy systematicity to access learners' cognitive processes. Under strategy systematicity we understand how well-directed karners explore a task. However, strategy systematicity is only a weak measure of specific cognitive processes because other factors, such as motivation, ability, or simple luck may influence which strategy is chosen. In particular, to analyse the learning process we need to take into account that different learners can represent the task in different ways, that is, they may have different models of the task (Burns & Vollmeyer, 1997). Their model will influence the cognitive aspects of the learning process, for example, what sorts of hypotheses they form and test. The model will also influence metacognitive aspects of learning. For example, if the task is evaluated as unfamiliar then a different plan will be necessary than for a familiar task.

The cover story we told our participants was that they were in a lab in which the effects of three medicines (A, B, C) on three substances found in the body (Thyroxin, Hi1.tamine, Serotonin) were to be tested. The structure of the system, illustrated in Figure 1, was such that one output was relatively simple to manipulate because it was influenced by only one input (Medicine A->Serotonin). The other two outputs were more complex, because each was influenced by two factors. One output (Thyroxin) was affected by two inputs, and the other (Histamine) is affected by a decay factor (marked as a circle connected to the output) in addition to a single input variable. The decay factor was implemented by subtracting a percentage of the output's previous value on each trial. Decay was a dynamk aspect of the system, because it yielded state changes even if there was no input (i.e., all inputs were set to zero). The system was thus complex in that it involved multiple input variables that had to be manipulated in order to control multiple output variables, and dynamic in that the state of the system changed as a joint function of external inputs and internal decay.

The critical issue is whether we adequately measured and sampled the range of values for our motivational and cognitive variables. Biology-lab appears to do this, as previous studies have found that participants find it challenging (in this study on a seven-point scale [l=low challenge, 7=high challenge], M=4.85, SD=.91), use a variety of strategies, and find the task difficult (only some reach the goal states).

Therefore, we could successfully classify participants as expressing failure, at a time they were likely to be confronted with it (i.e., when they must reach a difficult goal state). Metacognition was also difficult to analyse because there were few instances. During learning very few participants stated their plans or said how they controlled their learning.

Therefore, we correlated the initial motivational factors with the two analysable variables which were extracted from the verbal protocols in the learning rounds. Effective hypothesis testing could not be predicted by either challenge (for Rounds I to 3, p's>.60), or mastery competence (for Rounds I to 3, p's>.20). A pattern in the right direction, but not significant, could be found in that more interested participants had more effective hypothesis testing and participants with less incompetence fear had more detailed hypotheses. The effects of initial motivation were also small for analysis of results: For none of the three rounds we did find effects of challenge (p's>.20), mastery competence (p's>.40), or interest (p's>.20).

To analyse this process, the appropriate statistical analysis is a path analysis. Ideally, the new mediators measured from the verbal protocols should be added into the model. Unlike our previous study (Vollmeyer et al., 1997), ten participants finished before the third round. Therefore, we analysed the individual last round that each participant completed (i.e., for those who finished in the first round we analysed Round I, for those who finished in the second round Round 2, etc.). Thus in the present study we lost the information showing how variables develop and interact over the learning rounds. To our previous model, we added the cognitive aspects (hypothesis testing, analysis of results, and strategy for reaching the goal) and calculated a structural equation model using Bentler's (1992) program. The result can be seen in Figure 2. Fitting the theoretically derived model to the data gave a high model fit, CFI=0.98, x2(I9)=21.so, p>.31.

This initial motivation affected motivation during learning. As a good strategy was explained before working with the task, almost all participants followed our instruction on the first three trials of Round 1 (trial 1: 96%, trial 2: 96%, trial 3: 98%). As there is only a small variance we did not expect strategy to be affected by initial motivation. However, having a detailed hypothesis should increase persistence with a more systematic strategy, and assist with analysing the results more carefully. The model in Figure 2 shows, that these assumptions were confirmed. Having a more detailed hypothesis and a more positive motivational state (i.e., more fun, and a higher expectation of learning the system) led to more knowledge about the system's structure (structure score). This knowledge was helpful for reaching the goal state. Unlike in our previous study (Vollmeyer et al., 1997), it was not the motivational state during learning which was associated with goal achievement. In the present study, initial mastery competence directly affected how well the goal states were reached. Beside these differences across studies, there are also differences between what is shown by the individual correlations and by the path analysis. First, although the strategy for reaching the goal states was correlated with the mediating and performance variables, the variance in the model was better explained with other variables. Second, the same was true for interest. Interest correlated with mediating and performance variables, however, the latent variable explained more variance in the model.
