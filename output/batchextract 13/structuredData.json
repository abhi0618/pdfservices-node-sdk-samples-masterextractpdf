Metacognitive knowledge includes knowledge about oneself as a learner and the factors that might impact performance, knowledge about strategies, and knowledge about when and why to use strategies. Metacognitive regulation is the monitoring of one•s cognition and includes planning activities, awareness of comprehension and task performance, and evaluation of the efficacy of monitoring processes and strategies. Recent research suggests that young children are capable of rudimentary forms of metacognitive thought, particularly after the age of 3. Although individual developmental models vary, most postulate massive improvements in metacognition during the first 6 years of life. Metacognition also improves with appropriate instruction, with empirical evidence supporting the notion that students can be taught to reflect on their own thinking. Assessment of metacognition is challenging for a number of reasons: (a) metacognition is a complex construct; (b) it is not directly observable; (c) it may be confounded with both verbal ability and working memory capacity; and (d) existing measures tend to be narrow in focus and decontextualized from in-school learning. Recommendations for teaching and assessing metacognition are made.

Tacit theories are constructed without explicit awareness from personal experiences or interactions with peers. These theories may be difficult to change precisely because they are implicit. Informal theories are characterized as •fragmentary•; in other words, individuals may be aware of some aspects of these theories, but lack an explicit structure for organizing their beliefs about knowledge. Over time, these informal theories are expected to become more sophisticated and formalized. Finally, formal theories are highly systematized and structured.

By this time, students are also able to self-regulate efficiently, in terms of allocating study time and attention. Development of strategic knowledge continues through adolescence and young adulthood, when students learn about interactions between memory variables, such as task characteristics, strategies, and effort.

Sperling et al. (2002) developed and administered a self-report instrument for measuring general metacognitive knowledge and regulation in children in grades 3-8. Empirical results validated the instrument•s multidimensional approach to conceptualizing metacognition. In addition, the measure was significantly related to other, published measures of metacognition and only weakly correlated with measures of achievement. However, researchers found that mean scores on these instruments either decreased or stayed the same across grade levels. Thus, there was a slight tendency for younger students to earn higher metacognition scores than older students. The researchers speculated that because the instrument measures general metacognition rather than metacognition in the context of a specific subject, perhaps metacognition becomes more domain-specific as students age and acquire more specialized content knowledge.

Schraw (1998) recommends providing explicit prompts to help students improve their regulating abilities. He suggests using a checklist with entries for planning, monitoring, and evaluation, with subquestions included under each entry that need to be addressed during the course of instruction. Such a checklist, he argues, helps students to be more systematic and strategic during problem solving. Similarly, Kramarski and Mevarech (2003) provided students with sets of metacognitive questions, including comprehension questions, strategic questions, and connection questions, to be completed during the task. Comprehension questions were designed to encourage students to reflect on a problem before solving it. Strategic questions were designed to encourage students to think about what strategy might be appropriate for a given task and to provide a reason or rationale for that strategy choice.

Piaget touted the instructional value of cognitive conflict for catalyzing growth, typically achieved by interacting with another person at a higher developmental stage. Along similar lines, Vygotsky identified the zone of proximal development as the distance between what an individual can accomplish alone and what he/she can accomplish with the help of a more capable other (either a peer or adult).

For example, metacognition is not directly observable in students (Sperling et al., 2002). First, Whitebread et al. (2009) argue that self-report methods, such as the use of rating scales or questionnaires that ask respondents to describe their use of particular strategies, rely too heavily on verbal ability. In addition, techniques that ask respondents to •think aloud• while engaging in a task do not capture implicit cognitive processes. In other words, subjects may not be aware of their cognitive knowledge and monitoring, which suggests that think-aloud methods may underestimate an individual•s metacognitive capacity. Moreover, these problems are compounded in preschool- and elementary-aged children, whose verbal ability and working memory capacities are incompletely developed. Thus, self-report and think-aloud techniques may be especially likely to underestimate the metacognitive abilities of young children. Finally, metacognition is a complex construct, involving cognitive knowledge and cognitive regulation. Moreover, there are multiple types of cognitive knowledge (declarative, procedural, conditional) as well as different types of cognitive regulation (planning, monitoring or regulating, and evaluating). Metacognition also entails affective and motivational states, including concepts such as effortful control and inhibitory control.

Children were then tested on their ability to recall all the items. Another common task was to read a set of written instructions and indicate any omissions, mistakes, or areas of ambiguity. Schneider (2008) observes that the most studied type of procedural metamemory is self-monitoring. Assessments designed to capture this ability include ease of learning judgments, judgments of learning, and feelings of knowing. For example, ease of learning judgments typically ask students to study a set of test materials for a short amount of time and then assess their abilities to remember the material. After the students are tested on the material, their performances are compared to their initial predictions. Feeling of knowing judgments ask subjects to identify by name a series of pictures; when subjects cannot recall the word for a particular picture, they are asked whether they would be able to identify the word if it were shown to them. These predictions are then compared to their actual abilities to recognize the correct term among a list of options. Another indicator of procedural metamemory is allocation of study time. If subjects are given sets of material to memorize and are observed to allocate more study time to learning difficult concepts, this is an indication of strong self-monitoring abilities.

One puppet places an object in a specific location and then •leaves the room.• The second puppet moves the object to another, hidden location. When the first puppet re-enters the room, the subject is asked to predict where he will look for the object•in the original location or in the new, actual location.

Metacognitive regulation is the monitoring of one•s cognition and includes planning activities, monitoring or awareness of comprehension and task performance, and evaluation of the efficacy of monitoring processes and strategies. Insights experienced while monitoring and regulating cognition play a role in the development and refinement of metacognitive knowledge.

At the very least, metacognition can be seen as a supporting condition for critical thinking to the extent that monitoring the quality of one•s thought makes it more likely that one will engage in high-quality thinking. Motivation is the set of beliefs and attitudes that underlie the development and expression of metacognition. Thus, self-regulation includes the ability to manage and regulate affective states, and its effect on academic success is mediated by motivation. Children with better self-regulation of emotion experience more positive social relationships at school, which in turn increases their level of engagement and academic motivation. This improved motivation then enhances academic performance. Empirical research supports this link, as effortful control of affective states predicts future SAT scores, as well as reading and math abilities.

The metacognitive capacity of preschool- and elementary-aged children is limited by several factors, including the development of executive functioning and verbal ability. For example, maturation of the portions of the brain responsible for executive functioning does not occur until 3-6 years of age, which parallels the emergence of skills such as inhibitory control. Inhibitory control is believed to be a foundational skill for theory of mind development. Theory of mind, which predicts subsequent metamemory, may in turn be dependent on the development of verbal reasoning skills. More recent research suggests that young children are capable of rudimentary forms of metacognitive thought, particularly after the age of 3.
