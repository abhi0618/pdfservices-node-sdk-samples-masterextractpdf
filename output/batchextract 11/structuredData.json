As education becomes increasingly evidence-informed policy makers, school leaders and teachers are becoming increasingly research literate and have ready access to an ever-growing range of evidence about ‘what works’ in schools. Influential sources of evidence, such as the Education Endowment Foundation’s Teaching and Learning Toolkit, often indicate that teaching metacognition in schools can have a very positive effect on pupils’ outcomes. In this paper, we examine over 50 studies to ascertain the effect of teaching metacognition in schools on pupils’ outcomes and their wellbeing. Following our review it is clear that there is strong evidence indicating the when metacognition is effectively taught in schools then there is a very positive effect on pupil outcomes; there is less evidence about the relationship between teaching metacognition and pupil wellbeing, but the evidence which does exist is also very positive. Having identified that teaching metacognition can help improve pupil outcomes in schools, we then pose questions about the English government’s attitudes towards evidence-based practice. We ask why the government adopts some policies and strategies which have an international evidence base, while not adopting other policies or strategies which have at least an equally strong evidence base. This paper concludes by suggesting how policies and practices can be improved in schools, Initial Teacher Education establishments and at the level of national policy.

Veenman and Beishuizen, for example, suggest that metacognition accounts for roughly 17% of a child’s ability to be successful at school, while intelligence accounts for approximately 10%.

Following Flavell, the study of metacognition focussed on the field of psychology. This focus has since broadened to include other fields, including education. Quickly a consensus emerged that children who develop effective metacognitive skills are more likely to become successful learners than children who hold less effective metacognitive skills. In England, at least, this led to a growing interest in the use of metacognition across education. Various commercially available programmes designed to improve students’ metacognitive skills were developed, such as the Cognitive Acceleration programmes originating from King’s College London (Let’s Think 2017), the Somerset Thinking Skills Course (Blagg 2017) and Building Learning Power (Claxton, Chambers, and Lucas 2011). Although the dates of such programmes appear relatively contemporary, they each have their roots in the 1980s or 1990s. Such commercially available programmes did not gain significant traction in schools, despite the strong evidence base underpinning them. One of the reasons for this lack of take-up could well be that metacognition has not been a formal part of either the National Curriculum in England, nor a part of the recognised metrics used for accountability purposes. School leaders, understandably, tend to focus on things which are mandated or measured, and thus side-line other strategies which might be felt to be “nice-to-have”, rather than essential.

was for schools to teach children to develop these skills in children aged 11–19, and it was envisaged that the PLTS policy would be integral to the ultimately doomed Diploma qualifications. Yet, the PLTS framework was side-lined by the newly elected Coalition Government from 2011, along with the Diploma qualifications; although it still exists in the field of apprenticeships, it is rare to find schools utilising PLTS (Braun, Maguire, and Ball 2010). It should not come as a surprise that the PLTS framework became associated with the apprenticeship movement when one considers the degree of overlap between this framework and the so-called twenty-first century skills referred to above, which are generally supported by industry. What is more surprising, in some ways, is the willingness of the government to side-line this framework when it so clearly supports schools to help prepare young people for the world of work. There is a possibility that a version of this framework could be revital-ised with the recently announced Technical Level initiative (Boles 2016), which we will discuss later in this paper, but the government is surprisingly quiet about metacognition.

Programmes such as Shanghai Maths, for example, have been heavily promoted by ministers (Gibb 2016). Something that receives less attention, however, is the extent to which high-performing school systems, including Shanghai, Hong Kong and Finland teach metacognitive skills across their schools (Cheng and Wan 2017; Retna 2016; Vainikainen, Hautamaki, et al. 2015; Vainikainen, Wustenberg, et al. 2015;Yeung 2015). Shanghai has been developing approaches to “Design Thinking”(Retna 2016), which encourages students and teachers to engage with academic work using creative strategies typically associated with the design industry. Hong Kong is encouraging schools to adopt critical thinking approaches to classroom activities (Cheng and Wan 2017) as well as Higher Order Thinking skills (Yeung 2015). Finland has also put considerable effort into the development of thinking skills across the curriculum (Vainikainen, Hautamaki, et al. 2015; Vainikainen, Wustenberg, et al. 2015). This raises interesting and important questions about the reasons for the promotion and adoption of some strategies that are used in high-performing school systems over others. This also raises linked questions about the government’s reasons for adopting some strategies, which appear to be rooted in strong evidence, whilst not adopting other strategies, which appear to be rooted in equally strong evidence.

When academics turn their attention to the teaching of science, similar outcomes are observed (Zohar and Barzilai 2013), leading some to the conclusion that metacognition is most effective when used with mathematics or science. However, when research is conducted to specifically explore the cross-curricular impact of metacog-nition (Mannion and Mercer 2016; Perry, Albeg, and Tung 2012) these data suggest that metacognition has a much wider applicability. Indeed, it is fair to say that the evidence suggests that teaching and learning metacognitive skills and knowledge can add value across the whole curriculum.

Over a period of nearly 20 years, Veenman and his colleagues have studied children and young people in a variety of contexts from primary schools to universities. Using sophisticated quasi-experimental techniques, rooted in quantitative methods, Veenman is able to make a number of strong claims about metacognition. A central claim is that metacognition can be successfully taught from primary school level to university level (Stel and Veenman 2008, 2010; Veenman and Beishuizen 2004; Veenman and Spaans 2005; Veenman, Hout-Wolters, and Afflerbach 2006). Another claim is that in order to maximise the impact of the teaching, several conditions need to exist. First, metacognition should be embedded across the curriculum, rather than taught in discrete “metacognition lessons”; second, the purpose of the learning, including the metacognitive element should be clearly explained to the pupils; and thirdly, the learning should be extended over a long period of time (Veenman and Beishuizen 2004, 635). They also conclude that metacognition is a strong predictor of academic performance, implying that there is a strong relationship between the two (Veenman, Wilhelm, and Beishuizen 2004). This view is reinforced by Hattie (2013), who suggests that pupils are very clear about their own academic performance when taught appropriate skills of metacognition.

There is also emerging evidence that metacognitive strategies are effective for pupils with challenging behaviours in mainstream schools (Burgess 2012). Perhaps this should not be surprising, as most strategies which give children increased self-regulation will help them to become more successful learners.

However, this study is significant because it provides relatively strong evidence that teaching metacognition skills not only narrows the attainment gap between Pupil Premium students and non-Pupil Premium students, but actually reverses the gap (Mannion and Mercer 2016, 263). It should be noted that this is a relatively small study, focusing on a single, small secondary school and that further research is required to assess the generalisability of this result.

Thus, although there is very strong evidence that metacognition is related to better than expected pupil performance, the Teachers’ Standards (DfE 2011) which operate in England do not explicitly mention metacognition or any related aspect. Such a situation appears to put the government in an awkward position. On one hand they call for an “evidence-informed” profession (DfE 2016a), and recent guidance for Continuing Professional Development (DfE 2016b) states that CPD should be rooted in robust evidence. There is also a movement led by the Secretary of State for Education to strengthen Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and to ensure that enhanced professional development acts as a “golden thread” through every teachers’ career (Greening 2017b). In her vision for the profession, Justine Greening stresses that teachers should be “constantly seeking to improve teaching methods, use evidence, to look at research and stay ahead of the curve.” (ibid.). Yet, on the other hand, it would appear that only particular types of evidence are championed and actively encouraged. While the government has been keen to promote the “Shanghai Maths” approach, for example, it should also be remembered that high performing school systems, including Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and Finland, all include metacognition in their school curricula. There is also a clear favouring of strategies such as Randomized Control Trials (RCT) in education research, as discussed above. Yet it has been shown many times that such approaches are not appropriate for research into education; such a positivist approach may be attractive to politicians seeking votes and value for money, but education is intensely influenced by contexts. Thus, despite the clear and convincing evidence about the potential of metacognition and self-regulation to help improve pupil outcomes, and the fact that such strategies are integral to high-performing school systems, they are currently absent from the English government’s priorities for education.

In terms of school leadership, it is now widely agreed that leadership has a significant impact on pupil outcomes. Leithwood et al. identify that “School leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning” (Leithwood, Harris, and Hopkins 2008, 27). This corroborates Hallinger and Heck’s cautious but firm conclusion that headteachers “exercise a measurable, though indirect effect on school effectiveness and student achievement.” (Hallinger and Heck 1998, 186). Regarding the roles of different leaders in schools, Day et al. (2009) assert the primacy of headteachers. Leithwood and Jantzi (2005) use a meta-analytical strategy in an attempt to isolate the impact of such leadership on children’s outcomes and conclude that the available evidence strongly suggests a positive link between leadership and children’s outcomes; a commonly quoted figure is that the headteacher typically accounts for between 5–7% of student learning (Braun, Gable, and Kite 2011; Leithwood, Harris, and Hopkins 2008). This theme is taken up and supported by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD 2013) and McKinsey (McKinsey 2007), who both emphasise the significance of school leaders for improving student outcomes across the world. Some education systems, such as the evolving Welsh system, recognise the value of promoting metacognition in schools through leadership. The Welsh Leadership Standards (Wales 2016), state that a successful school leader, “Promotes and puts in place policies designed to enable learners to develop independence and to acquire thinking and learning skills.”  Headteachers in Wales need to demonstrate that they do this in their schools; there is no such equivalent in England and metacognition is absent from the Teachers’ Standards (DfE 2011), as noted above.

There is some research examining the effect of beginning teachers’ own sense of metacognition (Ozturk 2017); this suggests that where they have a relatively low sense of metacognition they are less likely to incorporate such strategies into their lessons, even when they have had detailed CPD about metacognition in the classroom, which is unsurprising. There is also strong, emerging evidence about the significance of teachers explicitly role modelling metacognition (Wall and Hall 2016) and how this can have a significantly positive impact on pupil learning.
